Description
===========

Tiny Forge theme encompass all the best features of the default WordPress themes in one place, plus more usability and code improvements!

It features elegant mobile-first HTML5 ready structure of Twenty Twelve, custom per-post headers and three footer widgets from Twenty Eleven
(plus forth footer widget to insert your copyright information), icon webfont support from Twenty Thirteen, Google Fonts support and Schema.org microdata format support. It's all there, you have everything in one neat package. Also you can upload your custom Header Logo to display it next to Site Title and Description.

Along with the main theme you will find an example of a child theme - an easy way to start developing with child themes! Tiny Forge can be used as a learning tool or your own little web development "framework". 

With its unique "Coding Tips system" Tiny Forge helps to understand how to extend parent themes and build your own child themes, hacking them the way you want it. You get the best coding examples from default WordPress themes and the best hacks from the child theme.

Tiny Forge theme at WordPress.org

Theme localization (Translations)
=================================

Attention Tiny Forge translators! Tiny Forge is based on Twenty Twelve code. If you want to prepare a translation for your language, 
use Tiny Forge POT file and as a reference for the translation of text strings use Twenty Twelve translation POT file. 
Twenty Twelve is part of default WordPress installation package so you might find it here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language

http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/twentytwelve


Quick start guide
=================

1. To make it easy for you to change the look of your website and to retain the ability to update Tiny Forge parent theme, I recommend using Tiny Forge bundled child theme. New WordPress users do not know how to create a child theme, so for that purpose I included an example of Tiny Forge child theme. You will find it under inc/tinyforge-child-theme-example.zip

Before activating child theme, you have two options: retain the ability to update the child theme or not. Child themes receive updates less frequently, but sometimes they may have new useful functions implemented. First choice (retain the ability to update) will be good for people who change things using only CSS styles. In this case you would activate child theme, but you would not change any actual theme file, but append new CSS styles with the help of plugin, like:

	http://wordpress.org/plugins/imporved-simpler-css/

	http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/

	http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-custom-css/

	http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-css-manager-plugin/

	http://wordpress.org/plugins/pc-custom-css/

With the arrival of new theme version, you could overwrite (or auto-update) theme files, because all your custom CSS styles would be safely stored in the database.

If you plan to make more considerable changes to the theme, I would suggest changing the child theme name, to avoid it to be auto-updated by mistake (in this case all theme files would be overwritten and you would loose all your changes). Open style.css file and change this line:

	Theme Name: Tiny Forge Child

to something like:

	Theme Name: Tiny Forge Child Custom

To install child theme, unzip file (inc/tinyforge-child-theme-example.zip) and upload this child theme as a separate theme alongside with Tiny Forge parent theme (both themes should be uploaded for child theme to work). 

Activate Child theme and you're ready to go! From that point all of your changes will be done in the child theme. If you need to modify a file, but it isn't present in your child theme's folder, just copy it there from the Tiny Forge theme. 

As a bonus Tiny Forge child theme has very nice search field in the top menu area (ported from Twenty Thirteen theme) and two new header images to give you an example on how to change the default header images in the child theme. To activate search field you have to create a menu and assign it as primary:

Admin. panel > Appearance > Menus

At the top see: "Edit your menu below, or create a new menu." and create a menu if it's a fresh WordPress install. Then at the bottom check "Theme locations: Primary Menu" and save the menu.

Read more about child themes:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

2. In WordPress Admin panel go to Appearance/Widgets, 
expand Footer Copyright Widget Area on the right side,
drag standard Text widget from the left side to the widget area, 
enter your copyright text in the text field (you may leave the title field empty), something like:

	`
    &copy; 2014 Your Name. All rights reserved
	`
	If you would like to support this project, you can add the link to Tiny Forge theme:
	
	`
	&copy; 2014 Your Name. All rights reserved. Using <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/twentytwelve-xtended-wordpress-theme-for-learning-and-site-building">Tiny Forge theme</a>.
	`

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

3. Go to Theme Customizer (Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Customize) and see if you need to change any visual aspects of your site.

	- If you will choose to upload custom Header Logo (display it next to Site Title and Description), I recommend to size its height to 85px.

4. Next, open functions.php file in a text editor and find sections:

	- 5.9 - Add optional meta tags, scripts to head (2.2 - in child themes)

	- 12.0 - Other functions (3.0 - in child themes)

	- Check if you need to enable (uncomment) any of the functions there.

	- If you enabled human.txt meta tag, open human.txt file in text editor and update it with your information.

5. Make it look clean (optional) Personally I'm not a fan of displaying a bunch of meta data on index page or on archive pages. I try to keep it as clean as possible 
to not mess with readers attention. But I had to enable all that meta info to pass theme evaluation. However it is very easy to fix it. To disable entry meta, located below the post in index/archive view, open style.css file in a text editor 
and search for Tip30, then uncomment next CSS block to hide entry meta section (with author, categories, tags) in the Index page and archive listings.

6. If you want to use icon webfont for social networks (as you can see it in the theme screenshot), use standard text widget in the Main Sidebar Widget 
(same instructions as with Footer Copyright Widget) with text like this:

	```    
	<a href="http://address-to-about-me-page" class="icon-webfont el-icon-user" title="Contact me"></a> 
	<a href="http://address-to-facebook-account" class="icon-webfont el-icon-facebook" title="Facebook"></a> 
	<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile/" class="icon-webfont el-icon-linkedin" title="LinkedIn"></a> 
	<a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/your-wp-name" class="icon-webfont el-icon-wordpress" title="WordPress.org"></a> 
	<a href="http://twitter.com/your-twitter-handle" class="icon-webfont el-icon-twitter" title="Twitter"></a> 
	<a href="https://plus.google.com/your-g-plus-account-number" class="el-icon-webfont icon-googleplus" title="Google+" rel="author"></a> 
	<a href="http://github.com/your-github-name" class="icon-webfont el-icon-github-text" title="Github"></a>
	```

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

Tiny Forge v1.2.1 (2013-08-23)
------------------------------

- Theme name change from 2012-XTended to Tiny Forge.
- Theme becomes parent theme with several bundled child themes to have an example on how to extend it. 
  So it's still based on the Twenty Twelve, but I will not have to maintain the relation to it. 
  That became very important with evolution of HTML5 elements and the fact, that WordPress team is not interested in evolving older default themes.
- Bug fix: sidebar select element with very long value to overflow theme boundaries.
- Enhancement: added Twitter Bootstrap code class.
- Enhancement: added Twitter Bootstrap button styles: class="btn" class="btn btn-custom", check style.css file for more button styles.

2012-XTended v1.1 (2013-06-16)
------------------------------

- Enhancement: improve icon webfont rendering for a:hover state (style.css).
- Enhancement: updated .clear class - taken from Twitter Bootstrap (style.css).
- Enhancement: improved icon webfont ul and li styling in widgets (style.css).
- Enhancement: declutter post listing for index page and archives - top and bottom meta is visible only for single posts (only for certain child themes) (content.php).
- Enhancement: added Tip13 - Add Twenty Thirteen search form to WordPress nav menu (functions.php, style.css).
- Enhancement: added theme support for default core markup for forms to output valid HTML5 (functions.php).
- Enhancement: non-existing HTML5 element hgroup replaced with div.site-branding (taken from _s) (header.php).
